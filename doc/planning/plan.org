* Plans (unordered)
** Coq integration
  - Integration with Coq build system (~dune~ or ~coq_makefile~)
    to process all files in the project.
  - Integration with Coq HTML documentation system (e.g. ~coqdoc~)
  - Integration with ~coq-lsp~ to query dependencies, resolve notation, etc.
** LLM integration
  - Simple LLM wrapper to talk to different LLMs. (e.g. [[https://www.litellm.ai/][LiteLLM]])
  - For initial debugging integrate with at least one self-hosted
    model (e.g. llama). This will allow us to debug test runs on big
    projects with many LLM queries without spending money.
